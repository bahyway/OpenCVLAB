To work from within Docker container , configuring jupyter for its password...


## **Connect to the Running Container:**

### 1. Open the Docker extension in VSCode.
- In the Docker tab, find your running container. It should be listed under "Containers".
Right-click on the container and select "Attach Shell". This will open a terminal connected to your running container.
Generate Jupyter Configuration File
Generate the Configuration File:

In the terminal attached to the container, run:
```
jupyter notebook --generate-config

```
This command generates a Jupyter configuration file at /root/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py.

### 2. Set a Password:
- In the same terminal, run the following Python commands to generate a hashed password:
```
python -c "from notebook.auth import passwd; print(passwd())"

```
Copy the hashed password that is printed out.

### 3. Edit the Jupyter Configuration File:
- Open the configuration file with a text editor. You can use nano or vi inside the container:
```
nano /root/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py

```
Add the following line to the configuration file, replacing 'your_hashed_password' with the hashed password you generated:
```
c.NotebookApp.password = 'your_hashed_password'

```
### 4. Save and Exit:
- Save the changes and exit the text editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, and ENTER.
